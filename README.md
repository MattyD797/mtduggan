## About

I focus my interest of machine learning in ecological applications. I am a senior undergraduate student at the Honors College of The University of South Carolina pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science and Biological Sciences. In these fields I study a variety of machine learning techniques, which includes Deep Convolutional Neaural Networks, Hidden Markov Models, and Brieman's Random Forests. I have studied and written about classification and identification in camera trap imagery, prediction of nesting behaviors of precocial bird species, and many more projects. My preferred languages are R, python, and java. Please check out my Linkedin page located in my contact information for a deeper description of my proejcts and publications. 

## Interests

I have always been attracted to the beach and ocean, however, my research are done on a variety of terrestrial taxa. I go to school in Columbia, SC, but spend my summer in my hometown of Emerald Isle, NC. This is where I spend my time doing what I love, including kayaking, skim boarding, and swimming. I recently grew a fascination with kite surfing! Besides water activities I really enjoy flying drones (Pilot 107) and 3D printing which had really begun my research experiences.
